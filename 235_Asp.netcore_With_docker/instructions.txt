To run this project,

1. Install Docker:

2. Run Migrations:
	- Open the Package Manager Console in Visual Studio (go to Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console).
	- Execute the following command to apply the migration: update-database
3. Change the database connection in appsettings.json with your local sql server connection string.
4. Create the file named as "docker-compose.yml" in in project root directory
5. Correct the .csproj path in Dockerfile
6. Map ports in docker-compose.yml
